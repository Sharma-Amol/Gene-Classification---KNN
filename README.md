# Sonar Data - Classification (KNN)

## Code
[Sonar - KNN](https://github.com/Sharma-Amol/Sonar-Data-Classification---KNN/blob/main/KNN%20Exercise%20%5BFinal%5D.ipynb)

## Context
The main goal is to create a machine learning model capable of detecting the difference between a rock or a mine based on the response of the 60 separate sonar frequencies.

Apart from KNN, focus is on using a PipeLine and a GridSearchCV tool, since these skills can be generalized for any model.

This exercise and the associated dataset were provided as part of the excellent course 'Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass' by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/), which I successfully completed.
